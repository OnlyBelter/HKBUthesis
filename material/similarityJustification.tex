\opening{\textbf{Dear Sir or Madam},}

My name is Lei Li.
I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science with student no. XXXXXXXX.
Two weeks ago, I submitted my thesis titled \textbf{Natural Language Explanation for Recommendations and Beyond} via the online submission system.
Today I was informed of a rejection, because of the high similarity index.
Here, I would like to justify why its similarity index is high with my previous publications.
My thesis is comprised of the following 6 papers/manuscripts, which are my own work done after the registration for the degree of Ph.D. at HKBU.
All of them are available online, even the second one that is currently under review.
I have obtained the consent of all the co-authors to write them into my thesis, and the publishers of these papers also agree me to do so.
My thesis's similarity to these 6 papers is 59\% (15\% + 14\% + 13\% + 12\% + 4\% + 1\%), which is quite close to the the reported 68\% of total similarity.
The other 9\% of similarity could be attributed to the bibliography, my curriculum vitae, and the declaration, which are all marked in colors in the report.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Paper 1. (\textbf{15\%, 1st in the similarity report})
	\item Paper 2. [\textit{under review but online available}] (\textbf{14\%, 2nd in the similarity report})
	\item Paper 3. (\textbf{13\%, 3rd in the similarity report})
	\item Paper 4. (\textbf{12\%, 4th in the similarity report})
	\item Paper 5. (\textbf{4\%, 5th in the similarity report})	
	\item Paper 6. (\textbf{1\%, 7th in the similarity report})	
\end{enumerate}

I hope that you could re-consider my submission. Thank you for your time.
